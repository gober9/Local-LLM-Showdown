# Local-LLM-Showdown
This repository serves as a training base for Large Language Models that can be run on edge devices (not requiring high amounts of compute power). The purpose of this is to evaluate the most popular LLMs on your local device and test which ones perform better at specific tasks. 

## Benefits of Running AI Locally
1. Privacy & Security
- Your data stays on your machine, avoiding third-party servers.
- Great for handling sensitive information without cloud exposure.
- No risk of API leaks or data logging by external services.
2. Cost Savings
- No need to pay for API calls to services like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.
- Once set up, running a model locally can be much cheaper in the long run.
- Avoids expensive cloud GPU rental costs for inference.
3. Speed & Latency
- No need to send requests over the internet and wait for a response.
- If optimized, responses can be faster than cloud-based models.
- Ideal for real-time applications like chatbots, coding assistants, and automation.
4. Full Control & Customization
- You can fine-tune, modify, or optimize models for your specific needs.
- Choose which model version to run (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, or Gemma).
- Ability to run quantized models (GGUF, GPTQ, etc.) for better performance.
5. Offline Capability
- No internet required, making it useful for air-gapped environments.
- Always accessible, even if cloud services go down.
6. No Rate Limits or API Restrictions
- No need to worry about token limits, API downtime, or request throttling.
- Unlimited usage once installed, with no extra fees per request.
7. Multi-Model Flexibility
- Run any LLM (Mistral, LLaMA, Gemma, Mixtral, etc.) instead of being locked into one provider.
- Use different inference engines like llama.cpp, vLLM, ExLlama, or Text-Generation-WebUI.
